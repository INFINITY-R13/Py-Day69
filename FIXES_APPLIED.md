# Fixes Applied to Infinity Blog

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Gravatar Filter Not Configured
**Problem**: Template used Gravatar filter but extension was commented out
**Solution**: 
- Removed problematic Flask-Gravatar dependency
- Implemented custom Gravatar URL generator function
- Added Jinja2 template filter for Gravatar support

### 2. ✅ Security: Hardcoded Secret Key
**Problem**: Flask secret key was hardcoded in source code
**Solution**:
- Added python-dotenv support for environment variables
- Created .env.example template with secure configuration
- Updated secret key to use environment variable with fallback
- Created setup.py script to generate secure keys automatically

### 3. ✅ Database Path Configuration
**Problem**: Database path mismatch between configuration and actual location
**Solution**:
- Updated database URI to use environment variables
- Simplified path to avoid directory creation issues
- Added proper database configuration in .env.example

### 4. ✅ Admin Access Hardcoded
**Problem**: Admin access hardcoded to user ID 1 without flexibility
**Solution**:
- Added automatic admin user creation on first run
- Environment variable support for admin user configuration
- Improved admin user management with proper checks

### 5. ✅ Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: Admin decorator didn't handle unauthenticated users properly
**Solution**:
- Updated admin_only decorator to check authentication status
- Fixed all template conditions to handle unauthenticated users
- Added proper authentication checks before admin operations
